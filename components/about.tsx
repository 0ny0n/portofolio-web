                  My journey in Computer Science began with a curiosity for how
                  interactive systems and digital platforms are built. Over
                  time, this curiosity developed into hands-on experience
                  through coursework, personal projects, and collaborative
                  assignments.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I have explored a wide range of topics, from designing
                  user-centered interfaces to developing interactive games and
                  web applications, with a particular interest in bridging
                  creativity and technical problem-solving. Each project has
                  strengthened my ability to write clean, maintainable code
                  while also considering usability and aesthetics.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Looking ahead, I aim to continue expanding my expertise in
                  UI/UX design, web technologies, and game creation, with the
                  goal of contributing to impactful projects that combine
                  innovation, functionality, and user delight.
